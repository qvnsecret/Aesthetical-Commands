## üé≠¬∑Social Media
Currently, Mytho does not have any official social media presence. We believe it's not necessary at this stage since the project is still in its early phases and our focus is on other aspects of development. However, if you are capable of managing and creating a social media presence for Mytho with approval from Mytho HQ, we would be interested in collaborating with you. Please note that this would be a voluntary role, as we are not offering **compensation** at this time.

## üìò¬∑Privacy Statement

At Mytho, operated by Reduce, we hold the utmost respect for your privacy. Only the Founder & CEO of the project has access to your personal information. Your privacy is of paramount importance to us. Please be assured that any personal information we collect is solely for educational purposes.
